> This project revolves around leveraging a robust 5-year operational dataset from the Global Superstore to build a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making, facilitate advanced analytics, and provide accessible and meaningful insights for the business.
>Starting with the design of a scalable data model, we adopt Dimensional Modelling principles and the Bus Matrix Architecture. This design choice ensures our model captures business processes accurately and flexibly accommodates potential growth and changes.

Once the data model is set, we carry out five intricate Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflows on SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to migrate data from operational systems to our newly established data warehouse. Our ETL processes are crafted with a focus on data integrity, accuracy, and efficiency, ensuring that the warehouse is populated with reliable, clean, and business-ready data.
